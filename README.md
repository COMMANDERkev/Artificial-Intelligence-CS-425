# Artificial-Intelligence-CS-425

### C++ Implementation, textbook for the class is Artificial Intelligence, A Modern Approach 3rd Edition, by Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig
* Artificial intelligence (AI) is a research field that studies how to realize intelligent human behaviors on a computer. The ultimate goal of AI is to make a computer that can learn, plan, and solve problems autonomously. In this course, we will study the most fundamental knowledge for understanding AI. We will introduce some basic search algorithms for problem solving; knowledge representation and reasoning; pattern recognition; computer vision techniques; and Machine learning.

## Project 1 - 8 Way Puzzle
* The 8 puzzle is a game invented by Sam Loyd in the 1870s. It is played on a 3-by-3 grid with 8 square tiles labeled 1 through 8 and a blank square. Your goal is to write an AI program to rearrange the tiles so that they are in order. You are permitted to slide tiles horizontally or vertically (but not diagonally) into the blank square.
## Project 2 - Sudoku
* The game is played on a square 9 by 9 grid, split up into 9 square 3 by 3 "sections". The goal of the game is to complete the grid so that each number appears exactly once in each row, column, and region. Further constraints are provided by "givens," fixed numbers that must remain unchanged in the grid. Your task is to write an AI program to insert the correct missing numbers in each empty cell.
## Project 3 - Wumpus World
* The wumpus world is a two-dimensional grid (we will use 4 by 4). An agent state consists of the following variables: alive (or dead), location, direction (which way it is facing - E, W, S or N), and whether it has the gold. An agent can execute 6 possible actions: turn left or right 90 degrees, move forward, shoot, or grab (the gold). An agent wins when it finds the gold. Entering a square with a wumpus or a pit causes the agent to die. Your task is to write an AI program to navigate the wumpus world to find the gold without dieing.
## Project 4 - Person Tracking
* Design an AI program to separate the background image from the foreground image and place a bounding box around the foreground image.
## Project 5 - Isolation Game
* There are two players “x” and “0”. Either player can go first Each player can move horizontal, vertical, or diagonal, 1 or more spaces. The space the player leaves is now blocked, and neither player can move to that space anymore. A player cannot jump over a blocked space, or the other player. The game is over when a player has no more legal moves. The player that runs out of moves to make loses. The goal is to block in your opponent, so they have nowhere left to move.
## Project 6 - Group ML Project (TBD)
* Students will from small teams and choice a topic to apply machine learning.
